# Program Project Kickoff

## Group Members

-   You can do the project alone / in groups. (Depending on Complexity)
-   Make sure about your team's availability for the project.
-   Talk to your potential team members and make sure that you are all on the same page.
-   Decide the roles and responsibilities of each team member.

## Decide on the project

-   What is the project about?
-   What is the goal of the project?
-   What is the target user?
-   Is there any existing project that you can use as a reference?

### Project Ideas

-   E-commerce with payment gateway integration (e.g. Stripe)
-   Social Media with message and notification system (e.g. WhatsApp)
-   Multiplayer Online Game with leaderboard (e.g. Chess)
-   Fitness App with calorie counter (e.g. MyFitnessPal)
-   Stock Market App with real-time data (e.g. Yahoo Finance)
-   Expense Tracker with budgeting (e.g. Mint)
-   Blogging Platform with comments and likes (e.g. Medium)
-   Any other idea that you can think of

> In case of your own idea, make sure that it is not too complex and you can complete it within the given time frame or too simple and you can't meet the requirements with it.

## Minimum Requirements

-   Full Stack Application.
-   Backend Server.
-   Frontend Client.
-   Database (NOT JSON file).

## Project Approval Requirements:

-   ERD.
-   At least 3 to 5 Wireframes.
-   At least 2 to 3 User Stories.
-   Tech Stack. (Can be modified in future).
-   Feature List (At least 5). (Can be modified in future).
-   Roles Overview - Backend Dev, Frontend Dev, DB Engineer. (Can be modified in future).

## Everything begins with data

-   What is the data you can access or get?

    -   User input
    -   Seed in
    -   API

-   What assets do you need and from where to get it?
    -   Images (e.g. Unsplash)
    -   Videos (e.g. Pexels)
    -   Audio (e.g. FreeSound)
    -   Game assets (e.g. OpenGameArt, itch.io)

## User stories / User scenarios

-   What are the user stories?
    -   General explanation of a software feature from the perspective of a user
    -   The purpose of a user story is how a piece of work will deliver value to the user
    -   Example:

**As a** user,
**I want to** be able to search for a specific movie
**so that I** can see the details of the movie.

-   User scenarios
    -   A user scenario is a description of a user's interaction with a system
    -   Example:

Title: Search for a movie

**Given** I am on the home page
**When** I search for a movie
**Then** I should see the details of the movie

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

Once you have written all of your user stories, decide which features will be part of the MVP.

> Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development.

**The most dangerous question is: What if...**

Think about Interview Scheduler project. We could have added a lot of features to it, but we decided to keep it simple and focus on the core functionality.

Some features that we could have added:

-   Add option to multiple interviews per appointment
-   Add option to access upcoming weeks
-   Add user authentication
-   Add interviewer profiles (update availability)

## Tech choices

-   What technologies will you use?
    -   Libraries
        -   Bootstrap
        -   SASS
        -   Axios
        -   Redux
        -   Moment
        -   Storybook
        -   Twilio
        -   Etc...
    -   Front-end
        -   React
        -   Vue
        -   Angular
    -   Back-end
        -   Node
        -   Ruby on Rails
        -   Django
    -   Database
        -   Firebase / AWS / Azure
        -   PostgreSQL
        -   MySQL
        -   MongoDB

## ERD

-   Entities are nouns. Identify the nouns in your user stories.
    -   Example:
        As a **user**,
        I want to be able to search for a specific **movie**
-   Columns are attributes. Identify the attributes of each noun.
-   Identify the entities and relationships:
    -   One to many
    -   Many to many (create a join table)
-   Draw the ERD

## Wireframes

> Wireframes are low-fidelity, black and white, sketches of the user interface. They are used to plan the layout of the user interface.

-   Draw the wireframes

## Design

You came to this program to learn how to be a developer, not a designer. However, it is important to have a good design. You can use a tool like Figma to create your design.

You can get an inspiration from the following websites:

-   [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/)
-   [Behance](https://www.behance.net/)
-   [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.ca/)
-   [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/)
-   [CSS Design Awards](https://www.cssdesignawards.com/)

**Cool idea:** Try to talk to UI/UX students and ask them to help you with the design.

Would be a great opportunity for you to pratice your communication skills and technical skills for them.

## Workflows

### Git

-   Never code on master
-   Never force push master
-   Merge conflicts happens. There are ways of minimizing them but you can neve get rid of them completely.
-   Use branches and pull requests

1. Create a branch ->
2. Work on the branch ->
3. Make a commit ->
4. Push to remote branch ->
5. Make a pull request ->
6. Checkout to master/main ->
7. Pull ->
8. Checkout to the branch ->
9. Merge master/main ->
10. Fix conflicts ->
11. Commit ->
12. Push ->
13. Merge pull request

## Project management

-   Use a project management tool like GitHub Projects.
-   Create a board for your project
-   Add tasks/issues based on your user stories
-   Allocate tasks to team members
-   Set deadlines (it is ok to change them later)

## Communication

-   Use a communication tool like Slack, Discord, etc.
-   Create a channel for your project
-   Add team members
-   Use the channel to communicate
-   Daily standup
    -   What did you do yesterday?
    -   What are you going to do today?
    -   Do you have any blockers?
-   Weekly report with Instructor (Decide Day and Time - first come, first serve)
    -   Update on the project
    -   What did you learn this week?
    -   What are your blockers?
    -   What are your goals for the next week?
    -   Update on the deadlines
